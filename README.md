# hello-world
This is a repository for practicing the GitHub flow. 

This is my second attempt at trying to learn how to use GitHub. 

So far, I am thinking of using this space to post the Python projects I did whilst on the Hyperion course, and then using the same project ideas
for learning to use Java in order to feel prepared for the application.
